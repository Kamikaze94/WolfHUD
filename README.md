# WolfHUD
## Description

This is a Mod collection of several useful HUD altering mods.
I've modified them and added features, I felt were needed or useful.
It was originally a recreated and updated version of GageHUD, since it was really painful to maintain with all the mixed up files.
Over time I added more and more useful Scripts and currently it becomes kind of an All-in-One solution...
Not sure if I want it to become that, but at least I added ingame Options to turn off functions you don't like. ;)

I got the permission from **Seven, ViciousWalrus, Undeadsewer, FishTaco, friendIyfire and Terminator01** for the use of their scripts and from N**ervatel Hanging Closet Monster** for using his icons.

**Huge thanks to [Kampfhörnchen](http://forums.lastbullet.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=19364) for creating a better logo and a banner.**

Keep in mind, that this is a development version. For a more stable release, get your version [here](http://paydaymods.com/mods/298/wolfhud).
