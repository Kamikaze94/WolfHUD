# WolfHUD
####Development Version
  
This is a Mod collection of several useful HUD altering mods.  
I've modified them and added features, I felt were needed or useful.  
It was originally a recreated and updated version of GageHUD, since it was really painful to maintain with all the mixxed up files.  
Over time I added more and more useful Scripts and currently it becomes kind of an All-in-One solution...  
Not sure if I want it to become that, but at least I added ingame Options to turn off functions you don't like. ;)  
__I got the permission from _Seven_, _ViciousWalrus_, _Undeadsewer_, _FishTaco_, _friendIyfire_ and _Terminator01_ for the use of their scripts and from _Nervatel Hanging Closet Monster_ for using his icons.__
