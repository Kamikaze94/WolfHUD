# WolfHUD

## Description

This is a Mod collection of several useful HUD altering mods.
I've modified them and added features which I felt that were either needed or useful, or both.
It was originally a recreated and updated version of GageHUD, since it was really painful to maintain with all the mixed up files.
Over time I added more and more useful scripts and currently it becomes kind of an All-in-One solution...
Not sure if I want it to become that, but at least I added ingame Options to turn off functions you don't like. ;)

I got the permission from **Seven, ViciousWalrus, Undeadsewer, FishTaco, friendIyfire and Terminator01** for the use of their scripts and from N**ervatel Hanging Closet Monster** for using his icons.

**Huge thanks to [Kampfhörnchen](http://modworkshop.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=19364) for creating a better logo and a banner.**

## Requirements

To make this mod work you will need to install __[SuperBLT](https://superblt.znix.xyz)__.

*Note: Regular BLT is, with Version 3.00 forward, no longer supported.*

## Installation (Direct Download)

1. [Download WolfHUD from here](https://github.com/Kamikaze94/WolfHUD/archive/master.zip) or clone the master branch.  
2. Open the downloaded archive, using WinRAR or 7Zip
3. Extract the **WolfHUD-master** folder into your 'PAYDAY 2/mods' folder
4. Start the game once. It will prompt you to update Federal Inventory.

## AutoUpdates

This mod uses SuperBLTs custom update URL support.  
When an update is available, you'll be notified about it in the game.  
The update can be downloaded and installed through SuperBLTs download manager.   
*(The installation-folder needs to be named **WolfHUD-master** for autoupdates to work!)*

## If you don't want/like Inventory Icons

To remove "Federal Inventory" go to your **PAYDAY 2/assets/mod_overrides/Federal Inventory** folder and delete it.
Don't download the "update" for it, obviously.
